# Technologies

I have chosen to use Open-source technologies in this guide, as they are a highly popular choice for building web applications and software systems. These technologies are known for their flexibility, customizability, cost-effectiveness, and extensive support from the community, making them an excellent choice for projects of all sizes and types.
