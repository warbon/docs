# ðŸ¤« About Me

Hi there! I'm your friendly neighborhood :shushing\_face:, and I'm a full-stack web developer with 15 years of experience. Over the years, I've built many web applications using a variety of front-end and back-end technologies, and I'm excited to share my knowledge with you through this comprehensive guide.

In this guide, I'll be walking you through the process of building a full-stack web application with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com/),[ and Laravel Web API](https://laravel.com/) in the [Laravel Homestead](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/homestead) environment. We'll cover everything from setting up your development environment to deploying your application to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). My goal is to make the process as easy and straightforward as possible, so that even new developers can follow along and learn how to build their own web applications.

As a developer, I understand the challenges that come with learning new technologies and building complex applications. That's why I've created this guide with new developers in mind, to provide a comprehensive and easy-to-follow resource for building web applications. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just getting started, I'm confident that you'll find value in this guide.

I'm excited to help you take the next step in your journey as a web developer, and I can't wait to see what you'll build with the skills and knowledge you'll gain from this guide. Let's dive in!\
