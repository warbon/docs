# NodeJS

Node.js is a popular open-source runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It's used to build a wide range of applications, from web servers and command-line tools to desktop applications and mobile apps.

To install Node.js on a Windows environment, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Node.js website at [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

4. Once the installation is complete, open a command prompt and type `node -v` to check the version of Node.js that was installed. You should see the version number printed on the console.

```powershell
C:\Users\user>node -v
v18.14.2

C:\Users\user>

```



That's it! You've successfully installed Node.js on your Windows environment and can now start building applications using Node.js. For more information on using Node.js, check out the official documentation at [https://nodejs.org/en/docs/](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/).
