# NodeJS

Node.js is a popular open-source runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It's used to build a wide range of applications, from web servers and command-line tools to desktop applications and mobile apps.

To install Node.js on a Windows environment, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Node.js website at [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. Click on the "Windows Installer" button to download the latest version of Node.js for Windows.
3. Once the installer is downloaded, run it and follow the installation instructions.
4. By default, Node.js will install to the "C:\Program Files\nodejs" directory. You can change the installation directory if you prefer.
5. During the installation process, make sure to select the "Add to PATH" option. This will add the Node.js executable to your system's PATH environment variable, making it easier to use Node.js from the command line.
6. Once the installation is complete, open a command prompt and type `node -v` to check the version of Node.js that was installed. You should see the version number printed to the console.



That's it! You've successfully installed Node.js on your Windows environment and can now start building applications using Node.js. For more information on using Node.js, check out the official documentation at [https://nodejs.org/en/docs/](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/).
